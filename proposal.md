# General description of project
> Building a fun chopsticks game for fun. 
Chopsticks (not sure where it originated from) is a finger game where you try to "kill" both of your opponents hands. (think there are some rules variation)

> Each player starts with 1 finger on each hand. Every turn, you can choose to tap your own hand/your opponents.
Your hand "dies" when it reaches a count of more than 5.

# Goals of project
