# General description of project
> Building a fun chopsticks game for fun. 
Chopsticks (not sure where it originated from) is a finger game where you try to "kill" both of your opponents hands. (think there are some rules variation)

> Each player starts with 1 finger on each hand. Every turn, you can choose to tap your own hand/your opponents.
Your hand "dies" when it reaches a count of more than 5.

# Goals of project
> Try to do minmax. I remember watching a video (CS 50 or something) about it and tried to implement tic tac toe but never actually finished it.

# Listing of features
- Functional game (that follows the rules + allow users to play 2 players)
- Minmax algorithm to determine best move

# External Scanning
> If you go on github and search "chopsticks ai" theres quite a lot of stuff there. 
> I think what i'll try to do different (although initial submission might be similar) is to maybe allow people to play the game online (but I have never done such things before so I'm not sure if i can do it)

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> Enjoyable, playable with friends

> Helps me learn the strategy (supposably there is one) to win/draw every time :D

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> Not sure whether I'm going to use any python libraries, but if i am going to make it into a website then maybe flask or something

# [Development Log](/devlog.md)
> You will be updating this section regularly
> - Week 5: Started of project
> - Week 10: Woohoo rushing everything moment
